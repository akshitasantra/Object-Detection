# Object-Detection with PyTorch and OpenCV
This project was for me to explore computer cision and object detection using pre-trained Faster R-CNN model from PyTorch's torchvision library. It detects objects in real-world images (like people or everyday items) and draws labeled bounding boxes around them.

# Features
- Uses Faster R-CNN ResNet-50 FPN pretrained on the COCO dataset
- Performs object detection on any input image
- Visualizes results with OpenCV and Matplotlib
- Demonstrates thresholding, bounding box extraction, and labeling

# Example Output
